Barbara A. (Peck) Northrup, a lifelong resident of Walton, died peacefully at Wilson Memorial Hospital in Johnson City on Saturday, Oct. 20, 2018, following an extended illness.

Gramma Barb, as she was affectionately known by her family and friends, was born Dec. 19, 1934, one of the ten children of the late Warren and Hazel ( Jaycox) Peck. Early in life Barbara and her siblings attended a one-room schoolhouse at the intersection of West Brook Road and Russell Road in Walton where she spent many happy days, recalling arriving early to start the wood stove, and being towed home on a sled in the winter by her older brothers. She also mentioned often the times she enjoyed during horse-drawn hayrides, the rigors of rural farm life, and the special relationship she shared with her father.

Barbara graduated from Walton Central School in 1952, and married Richard D. Northrup on July 2, 1954. Together they had four sons, with whom they operated a dairy farm on Pines Brook Road in Walton for six years in the early 1960s. There she tirelessly dedicated herself to ensuring the success of the farm, raising her sons, entertaining and cooking for countless friends and family members, and working outside the home. It was her work ethic and compassion for others which many will remember most. As a child she eagerly assisted her father on their farm, her mother in the house, and her older siblings with the care of their numerous children. She spoke frequently and with pride of the large number of young people, family and non-family alike, for whom she gladly babysat or otherwise welcomed into her home for extended stays of care, support and encouragement.

As a young mom, Barbara was employed in a number of jobs including working as a retail clerk at the J.J. Newberry Department Store, the Style Shop, and Kent’s Department Store in Walton. She also owned and operated for several years a Sears Catalog Store and Barb’s Restaurant in Walton. She later worked as a cook at the Smith Nursing Home, SUNY Oneonta, and the Delaware County Infirmary working until retirement at SUNY Delhi.

Barbara owned and maintained her home, where she lived independently, until her final illness, regularly greeting friends and family with baked goods, a quick meal, homespun medical advice, and the latest from Fox News and her police scanner, both of which seemed always to be on. Her hobbies included cooking (apple pies and cinnamon rolls were especially well-received), knitting (helmet liners for the military was her most recent favorite), gardening and spending time with her family. Most important of all is that Gramma Barb loved unconditionally and was equally loved in return. She will be greatly, and sadly, missed.

In addition to her parents, Barbara was predeceased by her brothers, Ivan (Polly) Peck, Winford (Doris) Peck, Warren (Kathleen) Peck, and Russell (a/k/a Tom) (Pansy) Peck, her sisters, Emma (Dick) Howland, Doris ( William) Rowell, and Rhoda ( John) Russ, granddaughter, Keilani, favorite nephew, Johnnie Loker, nephews Jimmy Peck and Thomas Q. Peck and niece, Alison Peck.

She is survived by her sisters, Gert (Paul) Loker and Louise Peck, her sons, Don (Nicole Mantha) Northrup, Richard (Dawn) Northrup Jr., Brian (Suzi) Northrup, and Bradley ( Laura) Northrup; grandchildren Jacquelyn (Zack Grondin) Northrup, Kevin ( Jocelyn Mellein) Northrup, Paige (Bryan Perez) Northrup, Bryce Northrup, Eric (Amanda) Northrup, Christopher Northrup, Corey ( Jessica) Northrup, Cody (Stephanie Willsey) Northrup, Caity (Michael Velten) Northrup, Alexander (Katy) Northrup, and Bradley W. Northrup; greatgrandchildren Gwynavere, Blaise, Irelyn, Bernadette, Darius, Logan, Kainoa, Eli, Abel, Hayley, Rebekah and soon-to-be born Colin, and many nieces and nephews, all of whom were very special to her.

The family would like to acknowledge the kind and special services provided by care giver Ashley Williams, and to thank the Walton Emergency Squad, Cooperstown Transport, and hospital staffs at Catskill Regional Medical Center, Delaware Valley Hospital, and Wilson Memorial Hospital for the excellent care they furnished.

Family and friends are invited to call on Saturday, Oct. 27, from 10 a.m. to 12 noon at the First Baptist Church, 55 Townsend Street, Walton where a funeral service will be held at 12 noon with Pastor Larry Light, officiating. A reception will be held following the service.

Arrangements are under the direction of Courtney Funeral Home, Walton.

In lieu of flowers, and accordance with Barbara’s wishes, donations may be made to the local chapter of the American Cancer Society, 13 Beech Street, Johnson City, NY 13790.
